3/21/25, 10:24 PM - +91 99016 90875: Good evening,
Sir I don't think there was any confusion, we just want to bring it to your attention the number of projects we have to work on
1. DAA and AIML EL
2. DAA project based lab
3. AIML project based lab
4. CN course
5. Basket course EL(bio and material science expect papers) 

The first three mentioned require reasonable effort and time to solve the problem. 
And we have to prepare for CIEs every other month. 

The whole of March was spent preparing for NPTEL exam. 

I sincerely request you to  think about the workload that needs to be done in such a short amount of time (2 months)
3/21/25, 10:24 PM - +91 99016 90875: I think it is unrealistic to expect quality content as our attention is divided on so many projects

3/21/25, 10:30 PM - +91 70199 01066: And we'll lose our rhythm too since we'll be participating with different teammates in different projects, and given such a short time it's a heavy load on our shoulders <This message was edited>
3/22/25, 9:48 AM - Prof. Satish Babu Aiml Rv: Hi all, do not clutter the group with all types of messages...we are just following what higher authorities decided at the college level. 

Project based lab exams are introduced for every branch not only for AIML.

Theory EL clubbing reduces your workload, you are supposed to convince the panel how different subject components are demonstrated. You should have exploratory mindset to identify such use cases.

CN course we kept the options open, there is no compulsion to club with DAA and AIML ELs.

We are not expecting  you to come up with unrealistic expectations. These are minimum requirements to quickly acquire skills.

If you have better suggestions to improvise the outcomes come and discuss personally.
3/22/25, 9:51 AM - Prof. Satish Babu Aiml Rv: Do not generalise the statement

4/13/25, 9:21 AM - Prof. Satish Babu Aiml Rv: An Appeal to All Students

Dear Students,

Yesterday’s tragic incident has left the entire AI & ML department family in deep shock. We are all still coming to terms with this unexpected loss.

Moments like these remind us how precious life is—and how even minor lapses in judgment can lead to irreversible consequences. It is a time for reflection and for making thoughtful adjustments to our actions so that we never have to carry the burden of grief or regret nor cause it for those who care about us.

As members of this academic family, it is our collective responsibility to look out for each other. Reckless risks that endanger life are never worth it. You're here to chase your dreams, and that journey demands responsibility, patience, and mutual support. Our principal echoed the same sentiment in his heartfelt condolence message yesterday.

On behalf of the department and with the voice of every concerned parent behind me, I humbly place before you a few heartfelt requests (or if you choose, take them as advice, reminders, or even rules):

Maintain discipline both on and off campus. Please don’t mistake freedom for license to take risks that bring only momentary thrill like rash driving, unsafe sea adventures, or other reckless behaviors.

Keep your loved ones informed. Always let your parents, local guardians, or residential wardens know about your whereabouts when stepping outside the campus. A simple message can avoid a world of pain.

Be honest about your movements and the company you keep. You may think it’s a small lie, but remember you are accountable for your safety and well-being. Truth builds trust and safeguards you more than you realize.

Let us honor the memory of our lost friend by choosing to be more mindful, more connected, and more responsible from this day forward.

With concern and care,
On behalf of the Department and Parents

4/16/25, 7:26 PM - Prof. Satish Babu Aiml Rv: Dear Faculty,

I’ve noticed that some students have been consistently arriving late to the first hour of classes. To ensure that students understand the importance of punctuality and to maintain the integrity of the class schedule, I request that faculty members do not allow students to enter class if they are more than 10 minutes late. If you do allow them entry occasionally, please ensure that their attendance is not marked for that session.

Thank you for your cooperation in this regard. <This message was edited>
